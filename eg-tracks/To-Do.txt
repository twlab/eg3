To-Do, 6/15/2025
1. remove extra setState for creating workers in the package version
2. showGenome on 3d
3. fix css
4. show hidden genomes in trackfactory
5. fix hover for metadata
______________________
11. implement g3d
    - get g3d working (finish) _done
    - implement old ui _working
    - create model for react tab, in genomeroot, check for dupe, like in trackmanager (tracks)
    - implment add and delete from tracks and update properly

______________________

finished
1. fixed slow loading on initial by moving worker to genomeroot
2. double render in queueTofetch because we update newDrawData twice on initial
3. overall performance improvement by not having to recreate workers 
4. finish npm package
5. working tab ui react layers 
6. fixed conditionally display in genomeroot
7. fixed loading placeholder


finished 
1. browser package and track package working with react 18 and 19
2. fixed two react version bug with packages and consuming app
3. fixed nodepoly package
4. implemented g3d ui 
5. fixed flexlayout bugs, when tabs are opened
6. added new system to manage track height so height changing works 
    with flexlayout
7. refactor const objects for package (need to implement in dev branch)\
8. working multi worker fetch(need to test for bugs and implement in dev)

8/13/2025
1. Need to fix when entering invalid genomealign tracks 


8/14/2025
STRESS TEST WORKER ALGO 
--1. SCROLL FAST TO SEE IF EVERYThing is loading correctly  (done)
--2. check scrolling fast to already fetched data (done)

--3. genomealign error checking for invalid url. fetch etc

--4. scroll fast and then add more tracks tthrough public, t
hen scroll back if its fetching the new tracks only that are added 
(done, fixed, when new workers after initial are added, it doesn't have an onmessage so we dont get back the fetch data)

5. check local add 
-- 6. check remote 
-- 7. check annotation add, fixed genomealign add cause it doesn't have worker
-- 8. check toolbar: zoom, regionselect, jump 
-- 9. check undo redo 
-- 10.check sessions 
-- 11. check genomealign: already checked(added as default, remote, multiple genomealign, add new genomealign to a group)
    : check deleting, resize, adding track following query genome, 
-- 12. resize
13. check more errors, and let the user which track has error
-- 14. cryptoUUID not working on somebrowser 

-- 15. fixed some bigwig bugs, found by jessica



8/20/2025
1. add better error checking
-- 2. integrate changes to npm packages
3. maybe change flexlayout to something else 
4. add props to genomeHub package
--5. add saving chromosome in sessions so custom genome can be rebuild 
-- 6. fix datahub bug
-- 7. history menu option
--8. fix strictmode, cause ref data not getting deleted after component unmount
--9. rework viewRegion and userViewRegion
-- 10. create a contextCoord convert to genomicCoord
-- 11. move toolbar to the top next to region controller

12 create intiial windowWidth before genomeroot and resize from root to manager
13 delte newdrawdata state in trackmanager
14 move viewRegion and UserViewRegion to trackrepresent and create genomeConfig there. 
15 in trackfactory instead of creating new track components, create one react track component and just change the data 
    so its not recreated everytime theres newdata or new index 

16. make each track component be able to react to state changes so its not recreated. 
17. take out local tracks when refreshing
18. create reorder many tab 
19. change zoom icon to original 


9/25/2025
--1. rework tracks component to not create a new react component drawing new regionselect and instead just 
    change and redraw based on new data

2. fix genes search, probably need to rework servers

--3. fix url param for datahub
--4. check sessions in genome picker menu, (finish import) (check: upload for new data format and old session format
, url params, etc)

5. legend width setting
6. check errors 
7. NEW FEATURE: IMPLEMENT SEPARATE COLUMNS, where user can compare tracks etc. NEED NEW package not flexlayout

--8. retryFetch track
--9. instance fetch fix(bug was not using await in createcache)
--10. reworked looking for dupe elements, checking while converting other elements/
--11. screenshot fix for new algo dupe
--12. tracklegend for error track
--13. reworked tool bar 
--14. toolbar css, search bar, reorder many, highlight
--15. escape to close, toolbar and menu
--16. history menu
--17. rework metadata menu

18. rework import in genome picker getMenuComponents
19. rework trackregioncontroller
20. check retry

--21. FIXED clearing memory cache
22 trackmanager line 1532


checking-

- Implemented a way for users to retry fetching a track if there is an error  (finish)
- Implemented History menu, allow user to change to past or future states (finish)
- Implemented URL param for datahub  (finish)
- Implemented shortcut keys for tools (finish)
- Allow users to import session in Genome picker menu  (finish)
- Pressing Escape now allow users to exit out of sub menus (finish)
- Reworked toolbar to fit screen when user zoom in and out (finish)
- fixed memory deleting memory caching (finish)




To: Do 10/15/2025

- legendwidth option 
- show toolbar, and metameta, trackregioncontroller for setting option
- error checking 
- new algo, store draw data not raw data, this reduces memory usage 
- gene search speed fix 



to do: 10/21/2025
- update version document 
- update readme docunmentation for eg3 
- update readme for embeded 
- update readme for package  on npm 
- add legendwidth setting 
- optimized a way to save draw data and find a way to process data and convert so it would take less space,
     ie: stream local or remote data and actively convert then deleted
    the chunk so it make space for incoming chunks 
- add view columns for tracks and have multi tabs 
- error checks 
- update package again 
- (maybe replace flexlayout)
